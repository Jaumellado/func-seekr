# func-seekr package

A useful atom package for developers that reuses Gist code easily.

It consults all public Gists and lets you filter them so you can look for any function you want written in any language.

To toggle: ctrl + alt + o

For developing this tool we used the latest version of the AtomAPI 1.0, including atom-space-pen-views classes.
